# Bamazon-app

### This is a *CLI (Command Line Interface)* application that allows the user to interact with a storefront called **Bamazon**.

There are 3 viewpoints for interaction:
* Customer view
* Manager
* Supervisor

The Customer view displays a table of products for the user to choose a product and purchase a certain quantity.

The Manager view allows the user some housekeeping tasks such as viewing the products with low inventory, adding more items and adding creating new products to add to the inventory of the store.

The Supervisor view allows the user to view a table of the store categorized into departments and calculated over head costs, sales and profit. As well as creating a new department.

In the backend the mysql database is updating the inventory of products as these changes take place.

* Node.js
* Express
